## What patterns look promising

### Emoji count in title
- 0: avg_score=0.0 (n=9)
- 2: avg_score=0.0 (n=9)
- 3+: avg_score=0.0 (n=1)

### Title length
- <= 120: avg_score=0.0 (n=14)
- <= 160: avg_score=0.0 (n=3)
- <= 200: avg_score=0.0 (n=1)
- <= 240: avg_score=0.0 (n=1)

### Dialogue pattern (You:/Them:)
- no: avg_score=0.0 (n=19)

### Has numbers/%/$
- no: avg_score=0.0 (n=2)
- yes: avg_score=0.0 (n=17)

### Has a question
- yes: avg_score=0.0 (n=19)

### Post time (local)
- early-morning: avg_score=0.0 (n=4)
- evening: avg_score=0.0 (n=12)
- late-afternoon: avg_score=0.0 (n=3)


## Next experiments

- Try 3-post mini-test next week maximizing the top 2 buckets from **Emoji** and **Title length**.
- If **Dialogue** = yes outperforms, bias toward ‘You:/Them:’ scripts.
- If **Numbers** bucket wins, include a % or $ in the X line.
