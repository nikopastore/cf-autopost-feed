# Recent Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Dash Handling ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Process aborted when detecting dashes
**Solution:**
- Instructed AI to avoid dashes in tags only
- Dashes are allowed in content
- Dashes automatically removed from hashtags during formatting

## Issue 2: Syntax Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** `SyntaxError: invalid character '—' (U+2014)`
**Location:** Line 317 in fallback payload
**Solution:** Changed nested quotes and removed em-dash character

## Issue 3: OpenAI Client Proxy Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** `Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`
**Root Cause:** GitHub Actions environment variables interfering with OpenAI client initialization
**Solution:**
1. Added fallback initialization in case of TypeError
2. Clear proxy environment variables in workflow
3. Use explicit timeout and max_retries parameters
4. Updated requirements.txt to use compatible OpenAI version range
